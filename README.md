# ShopSasmpleCypress Sample File Readme

This README provides an overview of the generic ShopSasmpleCypress project to help us get started with end-to-end testing using Cypress. This project serves as a template and demonstration of how to structure a Cypress project and write basic test cases.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with this sample Cypress project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Comes with Node.js)
- A text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

shopsamplecypress/
├── cypress/
| ├── fixtures/
| ├── integration/
| ├── plugins/
| ├── support/
├── node_modules/
├── .gitignore
├── cypress.json
├── package.json
├── README.md



- `cypress/`: This directory contains the core Cypress files.
  - `fixtures/`: Store sample data for your tests (e.g., JSON, fixtures).
  - `integration/`: Place your test scripts (`.spec.js`) in this directory.
  - `plugins/`: Add custom Cypress plugins here.
  - `support/`: Store custom commands and other utility functions.
- `node_modules/`: Node.js dependencies for this project.
- `.gitignore`: List of files and directories to ignore when using Git for version control.
- `cypress.json`: Cypress configuration file. You can customize Cypress settings here.
- `package.json`: Node.js project configuration file.
- `README.md`: The document you are currently reading.

## Installation

To install project dependencies, open your terminal and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd cypress-sample-project
```
Then, run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running Tests
To run the sample tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This command will start Cypress and open the test runner, allowing you to select and run your test cases interactively.

## Writing Test Cases
Test cases are written using Cypress commands and assertions. You can find example test cases in the cypress/integration/ directory. To create new test cases, follow these steps:

Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., my-test.spec.js) in the cypress/integration/ directory.

Write your test cases using Cypress commands. You can find Cypress documentation here.

Save the file, and it will be automatically picked up by Cypress.

## Custom Commands
You can define custom commands in the cypress/support/commands.js file. This is useful for reusing test logic across multiple test cases.

## Cypress Configuration
You can customize Cypress behavior by modifying the cypress.json file. For example, you can configure the baseUrl, browser options, and more. Refer to the Cypress configuration documentation for details.

## CI/CD Integration
To integrate this project into your CI/CD pipeline, you can use Cypress as part of your testing suite. You may need to set up headless browser options and include the Cypress run command in your CI/CD script.

## Best Practices
Keep your tests focused, independent, and maintainable.
Use custom commands and utilities to keep your test code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
Regularly update dependencies to benefit from the latest features and security patches.
